        <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielburg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in the next installment. During the five years between The Temple of Doom andThe Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several scripts before accepting Jeffrey Boam's. </p></div>

        <p>Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early
        20th-century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film's goal. Lucus Eventually focused on developing his 1977 space opera Star Wars. </p></div>

        <img src="./images/temple.jpg"><h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, critisizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination.</p></div>
